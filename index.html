        <h1>Lebanon is Under Attack.</h1>
        <p>Lebanon is under attack while you're reading this. Israeli forces are bombing and striking Lebanon, committing war crimes that are largely unreported.</p>
        <br>
        <p>• The Pagers Incident: On the 17th of September 2024, thousands of rigged pagers exploded in Lebanon. This series of explosions killed dozens of people, including an eight-year-old girl, and wounded over 3,000 more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>• Ongoing Israeli Strikes: On the 23rd of September 2024, Israel began a series of strikes across Lebanon, killing more than 700 Lebanese citizens (including 50 children) and injuring over 5,000 others. These strikes have displaced over 200,000 Lebanese citizens, forcing many to seek shelter in public schools and other institutions, while 31,000 fled to Syria.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These are just some of the atrocities committed in Lebanon, yet they often go unnoticed on social media. Please share this information and use as many hashtags as possible so that the situation in Lebanon reaches a wider audience.</p>
